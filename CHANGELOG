1.0            Initial announcement
1.0->1.0.1     Added a mechanism to deal with the fact that
               on windows extensions are tied to a specific
               python version
1.0.1->1.1     GUI enhancements:
- addition of, on the fly generated, 'trivial' and 
  'easy' levels;
- 'no warnings' mode: supresses most dialog boxes;
- cars are constrained to legal moves during drag and drop;
- optional car animation (contributed by 
  Jesse Weinstein<jessw@netwood.net>);
- color coding of solved/unsolved label;
- cursor now changes with car orientation.

1.1->1.1.2     
- fixed crash with "Restart" button when in "Trivial" or "Easy" mode;
- changes to property mechanism: game state no longer lost
when upgrading (nice if you have solved all 107 expert levels); 
- addition of statistics window.
- animated mode is now the def default

1.1.2->1.1.3
- fixed harmless bug in savefile (zeroes inserted in 'solvedlevels');
- fixed serious memory leak (one must use tag_unbind!!);
- created demomode;
- created standalone windows installer using py2exe and Inno;
- fixed ugly looking dialogs in Linux (changed default background of canvas);
- changed menu layout so that the menus look better in windows;
- worked out how to put Help menu on right of menu bar on Linux. 

1.1.3->1.1.4 
- fixed small regression in coloring of "solved/unsolved" label.

1.1.4->1.2
- Make PyTraffic work with Python 2.3.
- Nicer buttons and cars!
- Code cleanup.
- Rudimentary theme support
- Indicators in menus are reenabled. Apparently Python 2.3 fixes the display
problem on windows.

1.2->1.2.1
- Some support for cygwin. In order to display the readme you
need X and lynx. Sound should work provided somebody can build
an ogg enabled pygame on cygwin.
- Slightly improved detection of working pygame.
- Better handling of paths with spaces.


1.2.1->2.0
- Conversion to pygtk.
- Wrote basic pygtk canvas, since I didn't want to depend on Gnome Canvas.
- Suppressed caps in names of unix installers.
- Code cleanup.

2.0->2.0.1 
- PyTraffic is now compatible with pygtk 2.6.
- setup.py now honors the prefix argument. The default prefix (for non-binary
installs) is /usr/local.  It used to be /usr, which some people (rightfully) 
didn't like.
- Added INSTALL file.
- Renamed CHANGELOG.txt to CHANGELOG etc...
- Various .spec file cleanups.
- Replaced sys.exit() with os._exit() to fix the problem that the 
program does not properly quits after suspend (this has to do with
SDL I guess).
- Documentation updates.
- Changed shortcut in menus to Statistics.
- Escape or mouse click now ends demo mode.

2.0.1->2.5
- Added support for coordinate transformations to canvas.
- Added support for 3D themes.
- Added pack method to canvas to do auto-sizing.
- Bugfix: settheme was called twice on a menu selection (this is an issue with gtk).
- Made forced selection of English in Posix actually work: created Main.py. 
By analogy WinGame.pyw was renamed to WinMain.pyw.
- Converted themes to png format.
- Created a new 3D theme using POV-Ray. This will now be the default theme.
- Eliminated: animation menu item and ghost objects. Animated moves are now used
automatically after an action induced by a button push (like Hint, Undo, etc...).
- Replaced cursors by hand cursors. Arrows cursor don't make much sense on rotated images. 
This should really be theme dependent. 
- Documentation updates.
- Dead code elimination and cleanups.

2.5->2.5.1
Mostly invisible changes to comply better with Dag Wieers' repository.
- Got rid of 'prefix' hack. Setup.py now properly overrides install command.
This is necessary to have a (clean) separate build and install stage.
- Changed many files and directories to non-caps.
- Documentation is no longer installed twice.
- Filled in license field in setup.py.
- Rudimentary playlist support: drop files in <install_directory>/music.
- Changed .spec file based on the one created by Dag.
- Created subpackage for extra themes.
- Added two more extra themes (Blocks and FancyRotated).
- The install directory on unix is now <prefix>/share/pytraffic. Added a check 
against installing twice in the same directory.
Changes specific to windows:
- Windows installer does no longer take previous install directory
as default.
- Added freely distributable msvcr71.dll to windows full binary installer.

2.5.1->2.5.3
Mostly invisible changes.
- It is now possible to select the background music. So if you own
Autobahn by Kraftwork you can use that:-)
- Conversion of some dialogs to libglade.
- Conversion of some python objects to proper GObjects.
- Icons on buttons are no longer shown if gtk-button-images=0.
- Finally figured out how to properly reuse dialogs in gtk.

2.5.3->2.5.4
Mostly user invisble changes
- Standard gtk about dialog (using libglade).
- Eliminated rpmlint warnings on spec files.
- Install python C modules in <prefix>/lib/pytraffic.
- Xdg compatible install of icons.
- Removal of pygame dependency by creating a direct wrapper around SDL_mixer.
- Relocated some source files.
- Bumped up mixer output frequency to 44100 (was 22050). This should be an 
(advanced) configurable setting.
- Minor documentation updates.
- Spec files updates.
