<h2> The level file </h2> 
The precomputed levels are contained in the
file 'ttraffic.levels' in the install directory. The level file is
accessed through the module 'LevelFileParser'.
<p>
The file 'ttraffic.levels' does not contain solutions, only
levels. The format is as follows:
<ul>
<li> The file consists of a sequence of 4-byte numbers, lowest byte first.
</li>
<li> The file starts with a directory.
</li>
<li> The first number of the directory is 21.
</li>
<li> The next number of the directory is 52.
</li>
<li>The next number of the directory is the offset in the level file of the 
levels whose solution requires at least 20 moves.
</li>
<li>The next number of the directory is the offset of the 
levels whose solution requires at least 21 moves.
</li>
<li>
...
</li>
<li>The last number of the directory is the offset  of the 
levels whose solution requires at least 51 moves.
</li>
<li>After the directory come the actual levels. The levels are encoded
in two 32 bit numbers, corresponding respectively to the rows and columns.
</li>
<li>The rows and columns are encoded as 6 strips of 4 bits. The least
significant four bits correspond to the first row/column. The upper
8 bits of the 4 byte numbers are zero.
</li>
<li> Every strip is encoded as 4 bits, i.e. a number between 0 and
15. The corresponding strip is as follows (a,b are cars or trucks).
<pre>
0  ......
1  aa....
2  .aa...
3  ..aa..
4  ...aa.
5  ....aa
6  aaa...
7  .aaa..
8  ..aaa.
9  ...aaa
10 aabb..
11 aa.bb.
12 aa..bb
13 .aabb.
14 .aa.bb
15 ..aabb
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Note that there are no strips containing a car and a truck.

</ul>
