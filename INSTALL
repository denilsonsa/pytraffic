The generic, non-binary, install for a posix system is done 
using the command

      python setup.py install --prefix=<prefix>

You will need a working gcc toolchain, python (including headers and
libraries), pygtk and pygame. PyTraffic was tested with python 2.3,
pygtk 2.4 and pygame 1.6. Somewhat lower versions will probably also
work but this is not guaranteed!

The default prefix is /usr/local. If you use a standard prefix such
as /usr or /usr/local then a menu item will be created for pytraffic. 
Otherwise issue the command

     <prefix>/bin/pytraffic

to play. 

For other installation methods (including Windows) see doc/readme.htm.
